Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, 
but changing it is not allowed.


Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal
in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights
to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell
copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is
furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all
copies or substantial portions of the Software.

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR Preamble

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute 
copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source 
code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces
of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or
asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities 
if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities 
to respect the freedom of others.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a 
fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You 
must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must 
show them these terms so they know their rights.

Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions
of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is 
fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change 
the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products 
for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore,
we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products.
If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend  
this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect
the freedom of users.

Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should 
not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose 
computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents 
applied to a free 
program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that 
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.
